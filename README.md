This project focuses on the development of an intelligent visual inspection system designed to detect defects on a production line in real time. 
It combines a multi‑camera acquisition setup with an embedded AI model running on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano 2GB, enabling efficient on‑device processing despite limited hardware resources.

The system captures images from multiple synchronized cameras, preprocesses the data, and applies a trained neural network to identify anomalies or defective parts as they pass along the production flow. 
Its modular architecture allows the use of two cameras by default, with the capability to scale up to three or even four cameras depending on operational needs.

In the context of modernizing production lines, automatic defect detection through industrial vision has become a strategic lever for improving quality, reducing waste, and optimizing costs. 
Traditional rule‑based approaches quickly reach their limits when faced with the diversity of defects and the complexity of textures or materials.

Deep neural networks, particularly computer vision models, offer far superior analytical capabilities, able to detect subtle anomalies and adapt to production variations. 
To meet the requirements of responsiveness and reliability, these models must be deployed directly on embedded systems, as close to the sensors as possible.

In this context, we developed this project to provide a reliable solution for the company Prefer, which operates in the precast concrete sector. 
The primary objective is not to minimize energy consumption, but to maximize detection performance while keeping costs under control. 
This requires selecting efficient network architectures and hardware platforms that offer a balanced compromise between computing power, unit cost, and ease of integration.
